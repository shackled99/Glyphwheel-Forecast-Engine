# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Glyphwheel is a symbolic cognition engine under active development. We take system integrity and symbolic resilience seriously.

If you discover a vulnerability—such as recursion overflow, semantic loop failure, symbolic injection, or collapse protocol instability—please report it privately to the maintainer at:

**glyphwheel@protonmail.com**

All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with confidentiality. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work to resolve issues in a timely and transparent manner.

## Scope

This policy applies to all public components of the Glyphwheel repository, including:

- `core.py` (collapse synthesis engine)
- `mindbridge.py` (symbolic mapping and recursion logic)
- Interface templates and configuration files

## Response Timeline

We aim to acknowledge valid reports within **3 business days** and provide a resolution or mitigation plan within **14 days**, depending on severity and complexity.

## Disclosure Guidelines

Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix has been released or coordinated disclosure has been agreed upon. We value collaborative resolution and will credit responsible reporters in release notes if desired.
