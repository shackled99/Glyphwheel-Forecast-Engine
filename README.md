# Glyphwheel Forecast Engine ðŸŒ€  
**Recursive Cognition Simulator for Minoan, Voynich, and Rongorongo Symbolic Systems**

## Overview  
This project models symbolic cognition using recursive collapse theory, spiral attractor mapping, and cross-enigma drift simulation. Built on the Glyphwheel framework, it integrates ancient scripts into a unified ontology capable of forecasting emergent glyphs.

## Features  
- ðŸ§  **Ontology Core**: JSON schema of glyph nodes, collapse depths, drift tensions, and resonance vectors  
- ðŸŒ€ **Spiral Simulation**: Polar visualization of semantic growth using Fibonacci-like expansion  
- ðŸ”® **Forecast Engine**: Predicts emergent glyphs based on entropy tension and recursive hinge behavior  
- ðŸŒŒ **Cross-Domain Bridges**: Links Minoan, Voynich, and Rongorongo glyphs via symbolic welds

## How to Run  
1. Install Python 3 and required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```
2. Run the spiral simulation:
   ```bash
   python simulate_final.py
   ```
3. View the polar spiral map of glyph attractors and drift arcs.

## Theory  
The Glyphwheel Forecast Engine is based on recursive symbolic collapse, where each glyph stabilizes or fractures based on drift tension (Î¾) and collapse depth. The spiral topology mirrors Fibonacci growth, with nodes seeded across semantic arms and entropy fringes.
