# Contributing to Glyphwheel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Glyphwheel, a symbolic cognition engine for recursive diagnostics and collapse protocol synthesis.

We welcome contributions that improve the system’s clarity, functionality, and symbolic depth. This includes code enhancements, documentation updates, new glyphstream modules, and feedback on collapse logic.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your changes.
2. **Describe your changes clearly** in your pull request, including rationale and any relevant collapse sequences or test glyphstreams.
3. **Ensure your code is clean and tested.** We recommend using comments to explain symbolic logic or recursion paths.
4. **Open an issue** if you’d like to propose a new feature or discuss a symbolic interpretation before coding.
5. **Respect the Code of Conduct.** All contributors are expected to maintain a collaborative and professional tone.

## Areas of Contribution

- Symbolic parsing modules (`mindbridge.py`)
- Collapse protocol logic (`core.py`)
- UI improvements and interface clarity
- Documentation and sample glyphstreams
- False spiral detection enhancements
- Chant synthesis and anchor glyph logic

## Questions or Feedback

If you have questions or would like to discuss a contribution before submitting, feel free to open an issue or contact the maintainer at `glyphwheel@protonmail.com`.

We appreciate your interest in advancing symbolic cognition and recursive diagnostics. Every contribution helps evolve the system.
